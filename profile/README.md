# What we do?
We are an organization dedicated to high level sh*t.

# What is this for?
This is used to store [my](https://github.com/westillthinking) other projects that arent C/C++/C# on my account.

# Can I join?
Depends. Are you a skilled developer or engineer? Are you good with high level languages? If yes, just send my a message on Discord at: .stillinthelimbo
